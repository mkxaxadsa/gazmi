        'Chinese EV company Xpeng sees shares pop 6% after it launches mass-market car',
    content:
        'BEIJING — Xpeng shares rose after the Chinese electric car company launched its new mass-market Mona brand on Tuesday with prices starting as low as \$16,812, far below that of Tesla’s Model 3.\n\nThe Chinese automaker said orders for the Mona M03 electric coupe exceeded 10,000 just 52 minutes after the car’s formal launch in Beijing.\n\nXpeng’s U.S.-listed shares closed up 6.5% in New York trading on Tuesday, while its Hong Kong-traded shares rose nearly 2% early Wednesday morning.\n\n“With cars priced under \$20,000, China is further cementing its new position as the world center for automotive manufacturing,” Michael Dunne, founder and CEO of consulting firm Dunne Insights, said Wednesday on CNBC’s “Squawk Box Asia.”\n\n“China can produce cars more cheaply than anyone else in the world,” he said.\n\nXpeng shares extended gains from Monday after a filing showed the company’s founder and CEO, He Xiaopeng, bought at least 1 million shares each of the company’s stock traded in the U.S. and Hong Kong.\n\nThe total U.S. purchase was worth nearly \$10 million, according to the filing, giving He about 18.8% of the company’s total issued share capital.\n\nXpeng shares have lost more than 45% so far this year.\n\nTesla shares closed nearly 2% lower on Tuesday. Shares of Chinese electric car companies Zeekr and Li Auto rose, while those of Nio closed mildly lower.\n\n— CNBC’s Sheila Chiang contributed to this report.',

        'Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger customers pay over \$90 million a year in cash-back fees, federal agency finds',
    content:
        'Three of the nation’s largest retailers — Dollar General, Dollar Tree and Kroger — charge fees to customers who ask for “cash back” at check-out, amounting to more than \$90 million a year, according to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau.\n\nMany retailers offer a cash-back option to consumers who pay for purchases with a debit or pre-paid card.\n\nBut levying a fee for the service may be “exploiting” certain customers, especially those who live in so-called banking deserts without easy access to a bank branch or free cash withdrawals, according to a CFPB analysis issued Tuesday.\n\nThat dynamic tends to disproportionately impact rural communities, lower earners and people of color, CFPB said.\n\nNot all retailers charge cash-back fees, which can range from \$0.50 to upwards of \$3 per transaction, according to the agency, which has cracked down on financial institutions in recent years for charging so-called “junk fees.”\n\nFive of the eight companies that the CFPB sampled offer cash back for free.\n\nThey include Albertsons, a grocer; the drugstore chains CVS and Walgreens; and discount retailers Target and Walmart. (Kroger proposed a \$25 billion merger with Albertsons in 2022, but that deal is pending in court.)\n\n“Fees to get cash back are just one more nickel and dime that all starts to add up,” said Adam Rust, director of financial services at the Consumer Federation of America, an advocacy group.\n\n“It just makes it harder and harder to get by,” he said. “It’s thousands of little cuts at a time.”\n\nA spokesperson for Dollar General said cash back can help save customers money relative to “alternative, non-retail options” like check cashing or ATM fees.\n\n“While not a financial institution, Dollar General provides cashback options at our more than 20,000 stores across the country as a service to customers who may not have convenient access to their primary financial institution,” the spokesperson said.\n\nCustomers who opt for cash back are charged a “clearly disclosed” fee, which “helps offset the variety of costs we incur to offer this helpful service,” according to a spokesperson for Dollar Tree, which operates Family Dollar and Dollar Tree stores.\n\nA spokesperson for Kroger didn’t respond to a request for comment from CNBC.\n\nKroger, Dollar General and Dollar Tree were respectively the No. 4, 17 and 19 largest U.S. retailers by sales in 2023, according to the National Retail Federation, a trade group.\n\nThe practice of charging for cash back is relatively new, Rust explained.\n\nFor example, in 2019, Kroger Co. rolled out a \$0.50 fee on cash back of \$100 or less and \$3.50 for amounts between \$100 and \$300, according to CFPB.\n\nThis applied across brands like Kroger, Fred Meyers, Ralph’s, QFC and Pick ’N Save, among others.\n\nHowever, Kroger Co. began charging for cash back at its Harris Teeter brand in January 2024: \$0.75 for amounts of \$100 or less and \$3 for larger amounts up to \$200, CFPB said.\n\nCash withdrawals from retail locations is the second most popular way to access cash, representing 17% of transactions over 2017-22, according to a CFPB analysis of the Diary and Survey of Consumer Payment Choice.\n\nATMs were the most popular, at 61%.\n\nBut there are some key differences between retail and ATM withdrawals, according to CFPB and consumer advocates.\n\nFor instance, relatively low caps on cash-back amounts make it challenging to limit the impact of fees by spreading them over larger withdrawals, they said.\n\nThe average retail cash withdrawal was \$34 from 2017-22, while it was \$126 at ATMs, CFPB said.',

        'China’s first global gaming hit sells millions in a week. An early investor shares what’s next',
    content:
        'BEIJING – China’s first attempt at a top-tier video game has smashed world records, bolstering the industry’s global ambitions just a few years after Beijing’s gaming crackdown.\n\nBlack Myth: Wukong, an action game set in mythological China, sold more than 10 million units three days after its launch on Aug. 20. Ten days later, the title still ranked second by revenue in the U.S., and No. 1 globally, according to the Steam video game platform where it sells for around \$60 or more.\n\n“I think the next triple-A game is likely very close, because Black Myth: Wukong has shown everyone that a China-made AAA game can reach such high global sales,” said Dino Ying, chairman of Hero Games, which co-published the game and was an early investor in its developer Game Science. That’s according to a CNBC translation of his Mandarin-language remarks in an exclusive interview Thursday.\n\nYing said he knew of at least one such game under development, which his business partner at Hero Games has invested in. But he declined to share a timeframe.\n\nAs for how well Black Myth: Wukong has done, Ying only said sales have since increased by “much more” than the 10 million unit figure, although he indicated it had not yet doubled.\n\nHe said that in the future, the company’s game releases will have a global strategy from the start. He also expects foreign AAA game developers to realize how large China’s market is and tailor more features to Chinese players.\n\nAAA games generally refer to titles with high graphics quality and significant marketing. That’s meant such video games have tended to come from companies such as Nintendo, Ubisoft and Electronic Arts\n\n“China is a big country. We’re talking about 1 million concurrent players,” said Ivan Su, senior equity analyst at Morningstar. “China has 600 million gamers.”\n\nHe said the reason why China hasn’t previously developed its own AAA game, which are typically played on computers and consoles, is the years-long production time. “It’s much more cost-effective if you create mobile games,” Su said.\n\nApple’s Tim Cook visited Hero Games\n\nWhen Hero Games first invested in Game Science, Apple CEO Tim Cook visited in 2017 and was so impressed by the first game, Art of War: Red Tides, he gave it the front page of the iOS App store in 178 countries, Ying said.\n\nBut that wasn’t a commercial success.\n\nHero Games had already spent three years investing 60 million yuan (about \$8.5 million today) in two failed projects from Game Science when the developer approached Ying and his team in August 2020 about Black Myth: Wukong, he said.\n\n“We’re very lucky, we didn’t give up on Game Science before it succeeded,” Ying said, noting his business partner Daniel Wu, now CEO of Hero Games, had first discovered the startup.\n\n“We aren’t saying to blindly wait for all people,” he said. “When you see that kind of talent, you need to be confident that that talent has been underappreciated. It may not have found the right direction. [So you just need to] help it to find it.”',

        'Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway hits \$1 trillion market value, first U.S. company outside of tech to do so',
    content:
        'Warren Buffett’s Berkshire Hathaway reached a \$1 trillion market capitalization on Wednesday, the first nontechnology company in the U.S. to score the coveted milestone.\n\nShares of the Omaha, Nebraska-based conglomerate have rallied more than 28% in 2024, far above the S&P 500′s 18% gain. The \$1 trillion threshold was crossed just two days before the “Oracle of Omaha” turns 94 years old.\n\nThe shares were up 0.8% to \$696,502.02 on Wednesday, allowing it to top the \$1 trillion mark, per FactSet.\n\nThe milestone “is a testament to the firm’s financial strength and franchise value,” said Cathy Seifert, Berkshire analyst at CFRA Research. “This is significant at a time when Berkshire represents one of the few remaining conglomerates in existence today.”\n\nUnlike the six other companies in the trillion-dollar club (Apple, Nvidia, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon and Meta), Berkshire is known for its old-economy focus as the owner of BNSF Railway, Geico Insurance and Dairy Queen. (Although its sizable Apple position has helped drive recent gains.)\n\nBuffett, chairman and CEO, took control of Berkshire, a struggling textile business, in the 1960s and transformed the company into a sprawling empire that encompasses insurance, railroad, retail, manufacturing and energy with an unmatched balance sheet and cash fortress.\n\n“It’s a tribute to Mr. Buffet and his management team, as ‘old economy’ businesses ... are what built Berkshire. Yet, these businesses trade at relatively much lower valuations, versus tech companies which are not a major part of Berkshire’s business mix,” said Andrew Kligerman, TD Cowen’s Berkshire analyst. “Moreover, Berkshire has achieved this through a conglomerate structure, a model that many view as ‘archaic,’ as corporations have increasingly moved to specialization over the decades.”Greg Abel, vice chairman of Berkshire’s non-insurance operations, has been named Buffett’s successor. At this year’s annual meeting, Buffett told shareholders that Abel, 62, will have the final say on Berkshire’s investing decisions when he’s no longer at the helm.\n\n',

        'Buy now, pay later firm Klarna swings to first-half profit ahead of IPO',
    content:
        'Klarna said it posted a profit in the first half of the year, swinging into the black from a loss last year as the buy now, pay later pioneer edges closer toward its hotly anticipated stock market debut.\n\nIn results published Tuesday, Klarna said that it made an adjusted operating profit of 673 million Swedish krona (\$66.1 million) in the six months through June 2024, up from a loss of 456 million krona in the same period a year ago. Revenue, meanwhile, grew 27% year-on-year to 13.3 billion krona.\n\nOn a net income basis, Klarna reported a 333 million Swedish krona loss. However, Klarna cites adjusted operating income as its primary metric for profitability as it better reflects “underlying business activity.”\n\nKlarna is one of the biggest players in the so-called buy now, pay later sector. Alongside peers PayPal, Block’s Afterpay, and Affirm, these companies give consumers the option to pay for purchases via interest-free monthly installments, with merchants covering the cost of service via transaction fees.\n\nSebastian Siemiatkowski, Klarna’s CEO and co-founder, said the company saw strong revenue growth in the U.S. in particular, where sales jumped 38% thanks to a ramp-up in merchant onboarding.\n\n“Klarna’s massive global network continues to expand rapidly, with millions of new consumers joining and 68k new merchant partners,” Siemiatkowski said in a statement Tuesday.\n\nUsing AI to cut costs\n\nThe company achieved its adjusted operating profit “by focusing on sustainable, profitable growth and leveraging AI to lower costs,” he added.\n\nKlarna has been one of the forerunners in the corporate world when it comes to touting the benefits of using AI to increase productivity and cut operating costs.\n\nOn Tuesday, the company said that its average revenue per employee over the previous twelve months increased 73% year-over-year, to 7 million Swedish krona.\n\nIt comes as Klarna tries to pitch itself as a primary banking provider for clients as it approaches a much-anticipated initial public offering.\n\nThe firm earlier this month launched its own checking account-like product, called Klarna balance, in a bid to persuade consumers to move more of their financial lives onto its app.\n\nThe move highlighted how Klarna is looking to diversify beyond its core buy now, pay later product, for which it is primarily known.\n\nKlarna has yet to set a fixed timeline for the stock market listing, which is widely expected to be held in the U.S.\n\nHowever, in an interview with CNBC’s “Closing Bell” in February, Siemiatkowski said an IPO this year was “not impossible.”\n\n“We still have a few steps and work ahead of ourselves,” he said. “But we’re keen on becoming a public company.”\n\nSeparately, Klarna earlier this year offloaded its proprietary checkout technology business, which allows merchants to offer online payments, to a consortium of investors led by Kamjar Hajabdolahi, CEO and founding partner of Swedish venture capital firm BLQ Invest.\n\nThe move, which Klarna called a “strategic” step, effectively removed competition for rival online checkout services including Stripe, Adyen, Block, and Checkout.com.',

        'The IRS has a method of ‘last resort’ to collect overdue taxes: Revoking your passport',
    content:
        'Travelers, be warned: The federal government may revoke your passport if you ignore a big tax bill.\n\nSuch punishments have become more frequent in recent years, experts said.\n\nFederal law requires the IRS and Treasury Department to notify the State Department if an American has a “seriously delinquent tax debt.”\n\nThis is a large federal debt — of more than \$62,000 in 2024 — that the taxpayer has repeatedly ignored.\n\nThe debt threshold includes aggregate total federal tax liabilities, plus penalties and interest, levied against an individual. It’s adjusted annually for inflation.\n\nThe State Department generally won’t issue a new passport and may revoke or limit an existing one in cases of serious delinquency, according to the IRS.\n\nThe government typically uses this enforcement mechanism — which has been in place since 2018 — as a sort of last-ditch effort to collect unpaid tax levies, experts said.\n\nShould those debts remain unpaid, the potential consequences are ample: Travelers might not be able to take trips overseas until they’ve resolved their debt. Expats and those who travel abroad for business may have to return to U.S. soil indefinitely until their tax case concludes, for example, experts said.\n\nRevoking a passport is “a step of last resort,” said Troy Lewis, a certified public accountant based in Draper, Utah, and an accounting and tax professor at Brigham Young University.\n\n“How do you get rich folks’ attention regarding paying their taxes? Just make sure they can’t summer in Europe,” he said.\n\n‘It gets people to call the IRS’\n\nDemand to travel abroad has surged as the Covid-19 pandemic has waned. Americans applied for about 21.6 million U.S. passports in fiscal 2023 — a record number, according to the State Department.\n\nTodd Whalen, a CPA based in Denver, has seen tax enforcement efforts involving passports ramp up over the past three years.\n\n“This is becoming more and more of a big deal,” said Whalen, founder of Advanced Tax Solutions, which helps consumers and businesses resolve tax debts. “We’ve gotten several [cases] this year.”\n\nIn one instance, a client only found out his passport had been revoked while at the airport trying to fly to Mexico for a trip to celebrate his son’s high school graduation.\n\n“It works,” Whalen said of the collection effort. “It gets people to call [the IRS].”\n\nA State Department spokesperson declined to provide annual statistics on how many taxpayers had their passports revoked or denied. The IRS didn’t comment by press time.',

        'The peak interest rate era is over. Here’s what investors are watching',
    content:
        'Central banks around the world are set to kick off or continue interest rate cuts this fall, bringing an end to an era of historically high borrowing costs.\n\nIn September, the U.S. Federal Reserve is all but guaranteed to join the European Central Bank, the Bank of England, the People’s Bank of China, the Swiss National Bank, Sweden’s Riksbank, the Bank of Canada, the Bank of Mexico and others in cutting key rates, which have been held at levels not seen since before the Financial Crisis of 2007-2008.\n\nMoney markets had already fully priced in a rate cut from the Fed, but last week investors gained even more confidence in the path of easing ahead.\n\nAt the annual Jackson Hole symposium, Fed Chair Jerome Powell not only said the “time has come for policy to adjust,” but that the central bank could now equally focus on doing “everything” it can to keep the labor market strong and continue progress on inflation.\n\nCurrent pricing suggests high expectations for three 25 basis point cuts by the Fed before the end of the year, according to CME’s FedWatch tool. That will keep the Fed roughly in-line with its peers, despite it moving later.\n\nThe European Central Bank is seen cutting rates by 25 basis points at least three times in total this year; and the Bank of England by the same increment a total of three times, according to LSEG data. All three central banks are seen further continuing monetary easing at least in early 2025, even as stickiness in services inflation continues to trouble policymakers.\n\nFor the global economy, that means a broadly lower-rate environment next year, along with significantly reduced pressures from inflation. In the U.S., a recent spike in recession fear has largely abated, and despite where there is weakness in big manufacturing-oriented economies such as Germany, the likes of the more services-focused U.K. are recording solid growth.\n\nWhat all that means for markets is less clear. European stocks, as measured on the regional Stoxx 600 index, rebounded in 2023 from a downturn in 2022 and gained nearly 10% in the year-to-date to reach an intraday record high on Friday. On Wall Street, the S&P 500 index is 17% higher so far in 2024.\n\nThe VIX volatility index — which spiked amid the global equities downturn at the start of August — is back below average, Beat Wittmann, chairman and partner at Porta Advisors, told CNBC’s “Squawk Box Europe” on Thursday.\n\n“The market, in terms of price momentum, in terms of valuations, of sentiment, has pretty much recovered, and we are going into the seasonally weak September, October period here. So I would expect choppy markets driven by various factors, geopolitics, corporate earnings, bellwethers like from the AI sector,” Wittmann said.\n\nChoppiness will also be due to an “overdue consolidation correction” and some sector rotation occuring; but “the asset class of choice here very clearly for the rest of this year, and then especially for ’25 and beyond, is equities,” Wittmann added.\n\nEven if recent Fed commentary appears supportive for stocks, data from the U.S. jobs market — with the next key report due Sept. 6 — remains important to watch, Manpreet Gill, chief investment officer for Africa, Middle East and Europe at Standard Chartered, told CNBC’s “Capital Connection” on Monday.\n\n“Our baseline is still very much that a [U.S.] soft landing is achievable... It almost becomes a little bit more binary, because as long as we avoid that downside risk, equity earnings growth is still very supportive, and we’ve had sort of the positioning clean out in the recent pullback,” Gill said.\n\n“And I think rate cuts, or at least expectation of those, really was the last piece markets were looking for. So on balance, we think it’s a positive outcome,” Gill said, referring to the risk of U.S. economic data causing volatility in the coming months.\n\nArnaud Girod, head of economics and cross asset strategy at Kepler Cheuvreux, told CNBC Tuesday that bonds have had a strong summer and equities have recovered; but that investors must now take a “leap of faith” on where the U.S. economy is heading and the pace of rate cuts.\n\n“I truly think that the more rate cuts you get, the likelihood that [these cuts are] coming with negative data and hence weakening earnings momentum is very high. So it’s difficult, I think, to be too optimistic,” he said.\n\nThe stock market has meanwhile shown that there is an element to which it “couldn’t care less about interest rates,” Girod added, since Big Tech has rallied across the peak rate months — which conventional wisdom states should harm growth and technology stocks. That will keep events such as Nvidia earnings as the key ones to watch, according to Girod.',

        'Q2 Earnings Outperformers: Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) And The Rest Of The E-commerce Software Stocks',
    content:
        'Earnings results often indicate what direction a company will take in the months ahead. With Q2 behind us, let’s have a look at Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) and its peers.\n\nWhile e-commerce has been around for over two decades and enjoyed meaningful growth, its overall penetration of retail still remains low. Only around \$1 in every \$5 spent on retail purchases comes from digital orders, leaving over 80% of the retail market still ripe for online disruption. It is these large swathes of the retail where e-commerce has not yet taken hold that drives the demand for various e-commerce software solutions.\n\nThe 6 e-commerce software stocks we track reported a decent Q2. As a group, revenues beat analysts’ consensus estimates by 0.9% while next quarter’s revenue guidance was in line.\n\nValuation multiples for many growth stocks have not yet reverted to their early 2021 highs, but the market was optimistic at the end of 2023 due to cooling inflation. This year has been a different story as mixed inflation signals have led to market volatility. Thankfully, e-commerce software stocks have been resilient with share prices up 7.7% on average since the latest earnings results.\n\nShopify (NYSE:SHOP)\n\nOriginally created as an internal tool for a snowboarding company, Shopify (NYSE:SHOP) provides a software platform for building and operating e-commerce businesses.\n\nShopify reported revenues of \$2.05 billion, up 20.7% year on year. This print exceeded analysts’ expectations by 1.7%. Overall, it was a strong quarter for the company with a solid beat of analysts’ total payment volume estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ GMV (gross merchandise value) estimates.\n\n"Our Q2 results make it clear: Shopify is rapidly strengthening its position as a leading enabler of global commerce and entrepreneurship," said Harley Finkelstein, President of Shopify.\n\nShopify scored the biggest analyst estimates beat and fastest revenue growth of the whole group. Unsurprisingly, the stock is up 36.4% since reporting and currently trades at \$74.00.\n\nBest Q2: Squarespace (NYSE:SQSP)\n\nFounded in New York City in 2003, Squarespace (NYSE:SQSP) is a platform for small businesses and creators to build their digital presences online.\n\nSquarespace reported revenues of \$296.8 million, up 19.9% year on year, outperforming analysts’ expectations by 1.2%. It was a strong quarter for the company with an impressive beat of analysts’ billings estimates and a decent beat of analysts’ ARR (annual recurring revenue) estimates.The market seems content with the results as the stock is up 3.2% since reporting. It currently trades at \$45.48.\n\nBTC rose by 0.5% in the past 24 hours, whilst majors xrp {{XRP}}, Cardano\'s {{ADA}} and dogecoin {{DOGE}} fell by as much as 3%. The broad-based CoinDesk 20 Index (CD20), a liquid fund tracking the largest tokens, rose by 0.45% during the same period.\n\nU.S.-listed exchange-traded funds (ETFs) tracking BTC posted total net outflows of \$175 million on Friday, extending a losing streak to four days. Ether {{ETH}} ETFs had zero net inflows or outflows despite \$173 million in trading volume, data tracked by SoSoValue shows. Traditional markets will remain closed in the U.S. due to the Labor Day holiday.\n\nSome traders noted that BTC’s initial loss is in line with the bearish seasonality observed in September, but stated that interest-rate cuts by the U.S. Federal Reserve could break the trend.\n\n“September is a historically negative month for Bitcoin, as data shows it has an average value depletion rate of 6.56%,” Innokenty Isers, founder of crypto exchange Paybis, said in a Monday email. “Should the Feds cut the interest rate in September, it might help Bitcoin re-write its negative history as rate cuts generally lead to excessive US dollar flow in the economy – further strengthening the outlook of bitcoin as a store of value.”\n\nSeasonality is the tendency of assets to experience regular and predictable changes that recur during the calendar year. While it may look random, possible reasons range from profit-taking around tax season in April and May, which causes drawdowns, to the generally bullish “Santa Claus” rally in December, a sign of increased demand.\n\n“Overall, the macroeconomic indices, spot Bitcoin ETF adoption, and favorable hashrate might make September a relatively better month for BTC this quarter,” Isers wrote.',

        'Cash-to-Crypto Industry Dominated by ATMs Is a Law-Enforcement Concern: TRM Labs',
    content:
        'Law enforcement authorities globally have concerns about the use of crypto ATMs in scams, a report by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs found.\n\nLast year, over \$30 million went to known scam addresses through cash-to-crypto services.\n\nSince 2019, the cash-to-crypto industry – which is dominated by crypto ATMs – has processed at least \$160 million in illicit transactions, according to a study by blockchain analytics firm TRM Labs.\n\nThe report, released Wednesday, highlights why law enforcement authorities worldwide have concerns about the growing use of crypto ATMs, which take fiat currency and send crypto to the desired digital wallet. In 2023 alone, 79% of all illicit cash-to-crypto tranfers, over \$30 million, went to known scam addresses through cash-to-crypto services.\n\nCrypto ATMs were in the spotlight again earlier this month when Germany\'s financial regulator, BaFin, seized 13 in a raid, confiscating cash amounting to almost 250,000 euros (\$280,000). The report said such crackdowns are part of a "broader trend," citing the 2023 examples of the U.K. shutting down 26 bitcoin ATMs and U.S. authorities seizing 18 in Texas and more than 50 Bitcoin of America ATMs in Ohio. The U.K. charged a shopkeeper with operating an illegal crypto ATM for the first time, the BBC reported on Wednesday.\n\n"While illicit actors look to cryptocurrencies to move funds faster cross-border, crypto ATMs face additional money laundering vulnerabilities due to the use of cash and lack of face-to-face communication or account open controls," the report said.\n\nOf the 15,000 complaints last year involving \$1 billion in losses due to digital asset scams affecting people aged 60 and above, as many 2,000, some 13%, involved bitcoin ATMs.\n\nThe report said regulatory actions in the U.S. have forced over 1,000 machines offline since May, though the country remains home to more than 31,000 of them, the most in the world.\n\nAustralia, where the number of machines has grown 17-fold over two years, may have become the third-largest market for crypto ATMs. Authorities in the country have identified the kiosks as a money laundering vulnerability, the report said.',
